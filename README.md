# Bettershotz Website Clone

I made use of React and Tailwind CSS to create a clone of the home page of Bettershotz website. Original website is https://bettershotz.com/

Below is an image from the bettershotz homepage clone:

To get started with the project, simply clone the repo and then open your code editor and run the command `npm install` to install the packages. Then, run the command `npm start`
to run the app in development mode. It will open http://localhost:3000 to view the website in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

You can view the site on http://bettershotz-clone.netlify.app/
